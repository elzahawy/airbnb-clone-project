üè† Airbnb Clone Project
Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a backend-focused simulation of a real-world booking platform like Airbnb. It demonstrates how to design scalable systems, manage databases, and build secure RESTful APIs. The goal is to understand how professional backend teams collaborate to deliver robust and maintainable applications.

üéØ Project Goals

Develop a scalable backend architecture using Django.

Design and implement a relational database using PostgreSQL or MySQL.

Build RESTful and GraphQL APIs for user and property management.

Implement authentication, authorization, and data protection.

Deploy using modern CI/CD pipelines and Docker for containerization.

üë• Team Roles
Role	Responsibility
Backend Developer	Implements API endpoints, handles business logic, integrates database models, and ensures efficient API performance.
Database Administrator (DBA)	Designs and maintains the database schema, manages migrations, optimizes queries, and ensures data integrity.
DevOps Engineer	Sets up CI/CD pipelines, configures Docker containers, and ensures smooth deployment to production environments.
QA Engineer	Tests all APIs, ensures security and functionality, writes test cases, and reports bugs.
Project Manager	Coordinates development tasks, tracks progress, and ensures timely delivery of milestones.
‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack
Technology	Purpose
Django	Web framework for building the backend and REST APIs.
Django REST Framework (DRF)	Simplifies API development, authentication, and serialization.
GraphQL	Provides flexible query capabilities for data retrieval.
PostgreSQL / MySQL	Relational database for storing structured application data.
Docker	Containerizes the application for consistent deployment.
GitHub Actions	Automates CI/CD processes including testing and deployment.
Nginx	Serves as a reverse proxy for production deployments.

Relationships

A User can own multiple Properties.

A Property can have multiple Bookings and Reviews.

Each Booking belongs to one Property and one User.

Each Booking has one Payment record.

üåü Feature Breakdown
Feature	Description
User Management	Handles registration, login, and authentication using JWT tokens.
Property Management	Enables hosts to create, update, and delete property listings.
Booking System	Allows users to search, reserve, and cancel bookings.
Review System	Users can leave feedback and ratings on properties.
Payment Integration	Manages secure payments and transaction tracking.
Admin Dashboard	Provides administrative control over all platform data.
üîí API Security
Security Measure	Purpose
Authentication (JWT)	Ensures that only registered users can access protected routes.
Authorization	Restricts actions based on user roles (e.g., host vs. guest).
Rate Limiting	Prevents API abuse by limiting request frequency.
Input Validation	Protects against SQL injection and malicious payloads.
Data Encryption (HTTPS)	Ensures sensitive data is encrypted during transmission.

Why Security Matters:

Protects user personal and payment data.

Prevents unauthorized access and fraud.

Ensures trust and compliance with data protection laws.

üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous Integration (CI):

Automated testing and linting using GitHub Actions.

Code review checks before merging pull requests.

Continuous Deployment (CD):

Docker-based deployment to production servers.

Auto-deployment to staging environments for QA testing.

Tools Used:

GitHub Actions ‚Äî For automation and testing.

Docker ‚Äî For containerized environments.

Heroku / AWS / Render ‚Äî For hosting production builds.
